# DOSBox-core

A libretro core of [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) for use in
[RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com) and other
[libretro frontends](https://www.libretro.com/index.php/powered-by-libretro).
DOSBox-core is kept up to date with the latest sources from DOSBox SVN trunk.

The core provides some improvements over the DOSBox-SVN core:

* Native MIDI support on Linux and Windows.  
  You can select the MIDI output port in the core settings. The core will try
  to select the correct MIDI device even if the MIDI port changes in the
  future, as it remembers the MIDI port by name, not by number.

* Cycle-accurate OPL3 (YMF262) emulation.  
  Using [Nuked OPL3](https://nukeykt.retrohost.net).

* MT-32, CM32-L and LAPC-I emulation.  
  Using [Munt](https://github.com/munt/munt).

* Soundfont-based MIDI synthesizer.  
  - Using [FluidSynth](http://www.fluidsynth.org), a MIDI software synthesizer
    that supports SF2/SF3/DLS/GIG soundfonts.
  - Using [BASSMIDI](https://www.un4seen.com), a MIDI software synthesizer that
    supports SF2/SFZ soundfonts.

* Experimental 3dfx Voodoo support.  
  This is based on a [patch by kekko](https://www.vogons.org/viewtopic.php?t=41853),
  which in turn is based on MAME code. Currently, only software-based emulation
  is provided and as a result it is very slow. Most games will probably not be
  able to run at full speed yet.

* An on-screen virtual keyboard, ported over from the
  [UAE](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-uae) and
  [VICE](https://github.com/libretro/vice-libretro) cores.

* Other general, under-the-hood improvements and bugfixes.

DOSBox-core was originally based on the https://github.com/libretro/dosbox-svn
libretro core, developed mainly by [Radius](https://github.com/fr500) as well
as other contributors (the full commit history has been preserved.)

## Supported Platforms

* Linux (x86-64, ARMv7 (armhf))
* Windows 7 or later
* macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or later
* Nintendo Switch

It may work on other platforms as well if you build from source.

## Usage

You can load `.exe`, `.bat`, `.iso`, `.cue`, and `.conf` files directly. Note
that when loading content, the current directory is set to the content's
directory. This means it is possible to use relative paths in your `mount` and
`imgmount` commands.

### MT-32

For MT-32 emulation, make sure you have the correct MT-32 ROMs in your
frontend's system directory. See the `dosbox_core_libretro.info` file for the
ROM filenames and MD5 checksums.

### BASSMIDI

To use BASSMIDI for MIDI output, you need to download the BASS and BASSMIDI
dynamic libraries for your OS from https://www.un4seen.com and place them in
the system folder of your frontend. These files are not included with
DOSBox-core due to licensing issues.

On Linux you need `libbass.so` and `libbassmidi.so`, on Windows `bass.dll` and
`bassmidi.dll`, and on macOS `libbass.dylib` and `libbassmidi.dylib`. Make sure
to use the 32-bit or 64-bit versions of these files depending on whether your
frontend is 32-bit or 64-bit.

## Compilation

Building the core requires a C++17 compiler. GCC 9 and Clang 9 are known to
work. When building on macOS with XCode Clang, macOS 10.15 and XCode 11.1 are
required. Using GCC instead will allow building for older macOS versions.

CMake and Ninja are also assumed to be installed in order to build the bundled
dependencies.

Most of the dependencies are bundled. They are built and linked statically.
See `Makefile.libretro` for which make variables to set to enable/disable the
bundled libraries.

The only dependencies that are not bundled are alsa-lib, which is only needed
on Linux, and dlfnc which is needed on Windows. dlfcn is available as a package
in both MXE as well as MSYS2.

Note that the bundled dependencies are provided in the form of git submodules,
so prior to building the core, you should first perform a:

    git submodule update --init

To build on Linux x86-64 with the bundled audio, libsndfile, SDL and SDL_net
libraries, you would do:

    cd libretro
    make BUNDLED_AUDIO_CODECS=1 BUNDLED_LIBSNDFILE=1 BUNDLED_SDL=1 WITH_DYNAREC=x86_64 deps
    make BUNDLED_AUDIO_CODECS=1 BUNDLED_LIBSNDFILE=1 BUNDLED_SDL=1 WITH_DYNAREC=x86_64 -j`nproc`

The first `make` invokation will build the bundled dependencies, the second
will built the core itself. You can omit the first invokation and the deps
will be built regardless, but doing it this way results in a faster build.

Note that the `clean` target will clean both dependency
and core object files. To clean just core objects, use the `targetclean`
target. To clean deps only, use `depsclean`.

To specify which compiler to use, set the `CC` and `CXX` environment
variables. For example:

    CC=gcc-9 CXX=g++-9 make ...

If you want to cross-compile, you should set `TARGET_TRIPLET` to the prefix
string of your cross compilation toolchain. For example:

    make TARGET_TRIPLET="i686-w64-mingw32.static" ...

If you want to use a different CMake generator when building dependencies that
use CMake, set the `CMAKE_GENERATOR` variable. By default, it's set to `Ninja`.
