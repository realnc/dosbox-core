 * Routines for faking sleep() calls to dosbox.
 *
 * Normally, dosbox does its own timing so that each emulated frame loop takes 1000/FPS
 * milliseconds. This is not good for us. We need dosbox to deliver each frame as soon as possible
 * and let the frontend deal with timing. Do do that, we provide fake delay and tick routines
 * and let dosbox use those instead of SDL_Delay() and SDL_GetTick().
 *
 * (Instead of doing any of this, we could instead run dosbox in DOSBOX_UnlockSpeed(true) mode, but
 * this disables dosbox's automatic CPU cycle adjustment.)
